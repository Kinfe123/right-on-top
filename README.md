# Right on top of content

This is a very pure and dep pruned blog app with every core functionality that you want being implemeted natively with out you not bothering your `.pnpm-store` and `npm` almost with 0 deps  

- it is even built with out changing the nextjs theme at all - just straight to point project - introducing a new react mental model :) not new but suppotive mental model like `RSC` , `ServerComp` , `SSR` , `Hydration` , `react-dom/client` , `react-dom/server` - yeah by the end of the day it is all about the bundlers to be compatible with new appraoch that react runs on servers and streams down and supsended for UI
